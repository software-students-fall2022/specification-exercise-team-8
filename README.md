## Stakeholders

## Product Vision Statement

Our app gives users the ability to discover new study spots, filter by keyword and category and check the current population of existing spaces, and leave reviews on the quality of the space.

## User Requirements

1. As an existing user I want to check the current amount of people in a study space

2. As an existing user I want to be able to check which study spaces have accessories such as printers, charging spots, etc.

3. As an existing user, I want to rate study spots, so other users can know where the best ones are

4. As an existing user, I want to check the availability of a study space so I can study there

5. As an existing user, I want to search for study spaces by my location so I can find spaces conveniently near me

6. As an existing user, I want to search for study spaces by category so I can find spaces more suited to my needs

7. As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can keep track of my study spaces

8. As an existing user, I want to search for study spaces by name so that I can find specific spaces that I may enjoy

9. As an existing user, I want to add new spaces to the app so that I can keep track of how busy they are

10. As an existing user, I want to update a spaceâ€™s availability so that other users can be well informed
